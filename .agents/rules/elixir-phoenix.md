# Elixir and Phoenix coding rules

Load this file when writing or reviewing Elixir, Ecto, HEEx or LiveView code
in this repository.

Most of these rules come from the guidelines Phoenix writes into every new
project (`mix phx.new` generates them into its AGENTS.md). The Phoenix team
wrote them from practice, as the mistakes they saw most often. They are kept
here unchanged, except where a library differs from an application: this
library has no layouts, router, auth or asset bundle, and its components
must work without the host app's `core_components`.

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
  - One exception: `mix.exs` defines `Mix.Tasks.Compile.PhxMediaLibraryHooks` before the project. A compiler the library runs on itself must exist before the library compiles, so it can't live in `lib/` (spec 02, B13)
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

### Error handling

- **Return tagged tuples** (`{:ok, result}` / `{:error, reason}`) for operations that can fail
- Provide `!` bang versions for functions where appropriate (e.g., `add_media!/2`)
- Use custom exception structs for domain-specific errors
- **Never** raise exceptions for expected failure cases (e.g., file not found, invalid format)

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason
- Use `mix docs` to preview documentation locally before publishing
- Run `mix dialyzer` to catch type errors

## Test guidelines

- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

  - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages
- Tests that change application env **must** restore it exactly, including "not set" (`Application.fetch_env/2` before, `delete_env/2` after when it was unset)
- The library's own `config/config.exs` differs from an app's defaults; cover default behaviour with tests that run without that config

### Library-specific testing

- **Test with real files** in a temporary directory that gets cleaned up after each test
- Use `tmp_dir` ExUnit tag or create fixtures in `test/support/fixtures/`
- **Test all storage adapters** with the same test suite using adapter-agnostic assertions
- Write integration tests that verify the full flow (add media → store → retrieve → convert)
- Use mocks sparingly. Prefer testing against real implementations or in-memory adapters
- **Always** test error conditions and edge cases (missing files, invalid formats, storage failures)

## Ecto guidelines

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed together
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text` columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such an option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programmatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct
- **Always** invoke `mix ecto.gen.migration migration_name_using_underscores` when generating migration files, so the correct timestamp and conventions are applied
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` where you build queries

## Phoenix guidelines

The rules below apply to the components and Plug this library ships. Rules
about an application's scaffolding (`Layouts`, `current_scope`,
`phx.gen.auth`, router scopes, `<.flash_group>`, the `app.css`/`app.js`
asset pipeline) do not apply: the library has none of those and must not
assume the host app's.

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it
- **Never** write inline `<script>custom js</script>` tags within templates; use colocated hooks (below)

## Phoenix HTML guidelines

- Phoenix templates **always** use `~H` or .html.heex files (known as HEEx), **never** use `~E`
- **Always** use the imported `Phoenix.Component.form/1` and `Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` function to build forms. **Never** use `Phoenix.HTML.form_for` or `Phoenix.HTML.inputs_for` as they are outdated
- When building forms **always** use the already imported `Phoenix.Component.to_form/2` (`assign(socket, form: to_form(...))` and `<.form for={@form} id="msg-form">`), then access those forms in the template via `@form[:field]`
- **Always** add unique DOM IDs to key elements (like forms, buttons, etc) when writing templates, these IDs can later be used in tests (`<.form for={@form} id="product-form">`)

- Elixir supports `if/else` but **does NOT support `if/else if` or `if/elsif`**. **Never use `else if` or `elseif` in Elixir**, **always** use `cond` or `case` for multiple conditionals.

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      <%= if condition do %>
        ...
      <% else if other_condition %>
        ...
      <% end %>

  Instead **always** do this:

      <%= cond do %>
        <% condition -> %>
          ...
        <% condition2 -> %>
          ...
        <% true -> %>
          ...
      <% end %>

- HEEx require special tag annotation if you want to insert literal curly's like `{` or `}`. If you want to show a textual code snippet on the page in a `<pre>` or `<code>` block you *must* annotate the parent tag with `phx-no-curly-interpolation`:

      <code phx-no-curly-interpolation>
        let obj = {key: "val"}
      </code>

- HEEx class attrs support lists, but you must **always** use list `[...]` syntax. You can use the class list syntax to conditionally add classes, **always do this for multiple class values**:

      <a class={[
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5",
        if(@other_condition, do: "border-red-500", else: "border-blue-100"),
        ...
      ]}>Text</a>

  and **always** wrap `if`'s inside `{...}` expressions with parens, like done above (`if(@other_condition, do: "...", else: "...")`)

  and **never** do this, since it's invalid (note the missing `[` and `]`):

      <a class={
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5"
      }> ...
      => Raises compile syntax error on invalid HEEx attr syntax

- **Never** use `<% Enum.each %>` or non-for comprehensions for generating template content, instead **always** use `<%= for item <- @collection do %>`
- HEEx HTML comments use `<%!-- comment --%>`. **Always** use the HEEx HTML comment syntax for template comments (`<%!-- comment --%>`)
- HEEx allows interpolation via `{...}` and `<%= ... %>`, but the `<%= %>` **only** works within tag bodies. **Always** use the `{...}` syntax for interpolation within tag attributes, and for interpolation of values within tag bodies. **Always** interpolate block constructs (if, cond, case, for) within tag bodies using `<%= ... %>`.

  **Always** do this:

      <div id={@id}>
        {@my_assign}
        <%= if @some_block_condition do %>
          {@another_assign}
        <% end %>
      </div>

  and **Never** do this – the program will terminate with a syntax error:

      <%!-- THIS IS INVALID NEVER EVER DO THIS --%>
      <div id="<%= @invalid_interpolation %>">
        {if @invalid_block_construct do}
        {end}
      </div>

## Phoenix LiveView guidelines

- **Never** use the deprecated `live_redirect` and `live_patch` functions, instead **always** use the `<.link navigate={href}>` and  `<.link patch={href}>` in templates, and `push_navigate` and `push_patch` functions LiveViews
- **Avoid LiveComponents** unless you have a strong, specific need for them (`MediaLive` is one, see the design rules above)

### Shipped component styling

- Components ship Tailwind classes in their own markup, never in external CSS, so the host app can override every class
- Every component accepts `class` (and slots where layout varies) for full override; defaults should look good without customization and support `dark:` variants

### LiveView streams

- **Always** use LiveView streams for collections for assigning regular lists to avoid memory ballooning and runtime termination with the following operations:
  - basic append of N items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])`
  - resetting stream with new items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], reset: true)` (e.g. for filtering items)
  - prepend to stream - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], at: -1)`
  - deleting items - `stream_delete(socket, :messages, msg)`

- When using the `stream/3` interfaces in the LiveView, the LiveView template must 1) always set `phx-update="stream"` on the parent element, with a DOM id on the parent element like `id="messages"` and 2) consume the `@streams.stream_name` collection and use the id as the DOM id for each child. For a call like `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])` in the LiveView, the template would be:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, msg} <- @streams.messages} id={id}>
          {msg.text}
        </div>
      </div>

- LiveView streams are *not* enumerable, so you cannot use `Enum.filter/2` or `Enum.reject/2` on them. Instead, if you want to filter, prune, or refresh a list of items on the UI, you **must refetch the data and re-stream the entire stream collection, passing reset: true**:

      def handle_event("filter", %{"filter" => filter}, socket) do
        messages = list_messages(filter)

        {:noreply,
         socket
         |> assign(:messages_empty?, messages == [])
         |> stream(:messages, messages, reset: true)}
      end

- LiveView streams *do not support counting or empty states*. If you need to display a count, you must track it using a separate assign. For empty states, you can use Tailwind classes:

      <div id="tasks" phx-update="stream">
        <div class="hidden only:block">No tasks yet</div>
        <div :for={{id, task} <- @stream.tasks} id={id}>
          {task.name}
        </div>
      </div>

- When updating an assign that should change content inside any streamed item(s), you MUST re-stream the items along with the updated assign

- **Never** use the deprecated `phx-update="append"` or `phx-update="prepend"` for collections

### LiveView JavaScript interop

- Remember anytime you use `phx-hook="MyHook"` and that JS hook manages its own DOM, you **must** also set the `phx-update="ignore"` attribute
- **Always** provide an unique DOM id alongside `phx-hook` otherwise a compiler error will be raised
- A library cannot add hooks to the host app's `app.js`, so shipped components use **colocated hooks only**:

      <input type="text" name="user[phone_number]" id="user-phone-number" phx-hook=".PhoneNumber" />
      <script :type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook} name=".PhoneNumber">
        export default {
          mounted() {
            this.el.addEventListener("input", e => {
              let match = this.el.value.replace(/\D/g, "").match(/^(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})$/)
              if(match) {
                this.el.value = `${match[1]}-${match[2]}-${match[3]}`
              }
            })
          }
        }
      </script>

- colocated hooks are automatically integrated into the host's app.js bundle
- colocated hooks names **MUST ALWAYS** start with a `.` prefix, i.e. `.PhoneNumber`
- Use LiveView's `push_event/3` when you need to push events/data to the client for a phx-hook to handle. **Always** return or rebind the socket on `push_event/3` when pushing events:

      socket = push_event(socket, "my_event", %{...})

### LiveView tests

- `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` module and `LazyHTML` (included) for making your assertions
- Form tests are driven by `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`'s `render_submit/2` and `render_change/2` functions
- Function components are rendered with `render_component/2` (import it from `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`)
- **Always reference the key element IDs you added in the LiveView templates in your tests** for `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` functions like `element/2`, `has_element/2`, selectors, etc
- **Never** test against raw HTML of a whole page, **always** use `element/2`, `has_element/2`, and similar: `assert has_element?(view, "#my-form")`
- Instead of relying on testing text content, which can change, favor testing for the presence of key elements

### Form handling

- **Always** use a form assigned via `to_form/2` in the LiveView. `<.input>` belongs to the host app's `core_components`, so shipped components use plain inputs or `<.live_file_input>`:

      <%!-- ALWAYS do this (valid) --%>
      <.form for={@form} id="my-form">
        <input type="text" name={@form[:field].name} value={@form[:field].value} />
      </.form>

      <%!-- NEVER do this (invalid) --%>
      <.form for={@changeset} id="my-form">
        ...
      </.form>

- You are FORBIDDEN from accessing the changeset in the template as it will cause errors
- **Never** use `<.form let={f} ...>` in the template, instead **always use `<.form for={@form} ...>`**
